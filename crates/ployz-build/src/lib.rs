//! Shared BuildKit execution for one captured Build.
//!
//! A caller captures a Build's inputs into a private directory holding a
//! Compose file and the sources it points at, then executes that capture
//! here: execute, verify the image, clean up. Builder lifecycle, subprocess
//! orchestration, image import, and cleanup stay private so no caller has to
//! restate them.
//!
//! BuildKit owns build options and their validation; this crate hands it the
//! captured Compose file and adds only the rules BuildKit cannot enforce: one
//! bounded attempt, and one image bound to the content that attempt produced.

description: Server status, what runs where, roles, upgrades, and removing a server.
---

The **Servers** page lists every server in your organization. Open one to see what runs on it,
turn builds on or off, or remove it.

## Check your servers

Each row shows a server's name, the services on it, what it can store, and its status. Above the
list, a summary reads **All 3 online**, or puts problems first, like **1 offline · 2 online**.

![The Servers page, listing each server, what runs on it and its status](../images/servers-page.png)

| Status | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Online** | The server is up and in touch with your other servers. |
| **Building** | Online, and running builds right now. |
| **Offline** | Your other servers can't reach it. See [A server shows Offline](../troubleshooting/servers.md#a-server-shows-offline). |
| **Unknown** | Ployz can't tell whether it's up. Check it as you would an offline one. |

**Managed volumes available** means the server can hold [managed volumes](../services/volumes.md).
**Docker only** means it was added with **Start without it** and holds plain Docker volumes only.

If the page shows **Can't reach your servers right now**, see
[Troubleshooting servers](../troubleshooting/servers.md#cant-reach-your-servers-right-now).

## See what runs on a server

Click a server. Its page shows its status and public IP address, then:

- **Running here**: click it to list the server's services. While the server is offline, each one
  says whether it's **Still on** another server or **Down**.
- **Builds**: **Run builds here** and **Builds at once**. See
  [Where builds run](../builds/where-builds-run.md#build-on-your-servers).

![A server's page: Running here, Builds and Remove server](../images/server-page.png)

An entry marked **Not in any Project** is left over from a deleted project or environment.
**Remove** deletes its containers and its volumes, data included, from every server.

## Change what a server does

Every server runs builds, runs services and takes web traffic. To turn one off, see
[Give servers different jobs](../services/scaling.md#give-servers-different-jobs): services move
off on your next deploy. To move them off now, drain the server. This is CLI-only for now:

```sh
ployz server drain web-2
```

Draining turns services off for the server, then moves each replicated service's containers to
your other servers one at a time. Each new container runs the same image and starts serving
before the old one stops, so the service keeps answering. Pre-deploy commands don't run again,
and nothing is deployed. Ployz reports what moved where, then what still runs on the server,
such as a service whose volume is on it. Run it again to retry what failed. Turning services back
on doesn't move anything back.

Turning web traffic off stops advertising the server, not serving from
it: your generated addresses stop pointing at it within the hour, or when you click **Check
again** under **Domain** in **Organization → General**. Until then, visitors still sent to it are
served from wherever your services run. [Removing the server](#remove-a-server) is what stops it
taking traffic.

## Upgrade Ployz on a server

Servers don't upgrade themselves, and the dashboard can't upgrade them yet. This is CLI-only for
now:

```sh
# stable, beta, or an exact version like 0.2.0, on web-1 then web-2
ployz server upgrade stable web-1 web-2
```

Your apps keep running. Ployz stops at the first server that fails.

## Remove a server

> [!WARNING]
> Volumes stay on the removed server's disk, but your services lose them. Copy off any data you
> need first.

1. Open the server and click **Remove server**.
2. Ployz lists the volumes on the server. Type the server's name and click **Remove**.

<!-- screenshot: the Remove web-2? dialog listing one volume, with the name typed -->

[Drain the server](#change-what-a-server-does) first to move its services off without a gap.
Otherwise services that ran only on that server stop. Your next deploy replaces its replicas on your other
servers, except for services whose volume was on it (see
[When a server goes down](../services/scaling.md#when-a-server-goes-down)). Removing your last
server stops everything; your projects and settings stay, and the bottom bar shows **Add a server**
until you [add one](add-a-server.md).

If the server is unreachable, remove it without resetting it. This is CLI-only for now:

```sh
ployz server rm web-2 --no-reset --confirm web-2
```

Ployz stays installed on a removed server, so you can add it again later. To remove Ployz itself,
run `sudo ployz-uninstall` on the server after you remove it. Docker, your images and your volume
data stay on the disk.

## Forget servers you deleted

If you deleted all your servers at your provider, forget them:

1. Go to **Organization** and, under **Danger**, click **Forget Servers**. When the **Servers**
   page can't reach your servers, **Forget them and start over.** opens the same dialog.
2. Ployz lists the servers and their volumes. Type your organization's slug and click **Forget
   Servers**.

Ployz refuses while any server answers. Your projects, settings and deployment history stay, but
volume data on the forgotten servers can't be recovered. When you add a server again, Ployz deploys
your environments to it.

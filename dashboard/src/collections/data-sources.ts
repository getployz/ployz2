/**
 * Every file that creates a dashboard data source. `data-boundaries.static.test.ts`
 * fails when a file creates a collection or Query read without an entry here.
 * The test guarantees the list is complete. `kind` and `freshness` are reviewed documentation:
 * they explain the policy and why, while the code is authoritative.
 *
 * - `org-store`: Cloud-owned rows for one organization, loaded eagerly and org-wide,
 *   ready behind the shell's single content gate, read with live queries.
 * - `runtime`: core runtime testimony pushed over SSE into local collections.
 * - `remote`: third-party, unbounded, or on-demand reads through Query, with explicit `staleTime`.
